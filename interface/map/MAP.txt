A map cannot contain duplicate keys: Each key can map to at most one value. It models the mathematical function abstraction.
The Java platform contains three general-purpose Map implementations: HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap. 
Their behavior and performance are precisely analogous to HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet, as described in The Set Interface section.
